# Smart Expense Tracker

A smart expense tracking application designed for the Laurentian University community. This project combines a C++ GUI for logging expenses, a machine learning model for predicting monthly spending trends, and n8n automation for data synchronization and budget alerts.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project helps university students manage their monthly expenses more effectively. Users log their expenses through a C++ GUI. A machine learning model trained in Google Colab analyzes the data to predict future spending trends. The app integrates with n8n to automate saving data to Google Sheets or Notion and sending weekly budget alerts.
